# UFOs Analysis  
  
## Overview     

The purpose of this project is to compile data from different UFO encounters around the US and present them on one easy to use webpage.
This webpage is created through JavaScript, html, and css.  

## Results

Here is an image of the webpage.

On the webpage you can scroll through the table to see all of the different UFO sightings or you can use the filters on the left side. These filters allow you to filter the table by the date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO seen.

## Summary

This webpage does give a great overview of UFO sightings in the US, but it does have a few shortcomings. The biggest one is that does not have the functionality to add live data as it comes in. The data that is a part of the data file will stay the same unless someone manually goes in and updates it.

With that being said, the two recommendations for future changes would be the implement live data functionality and be able to filter both the duration of the sighting and buzz words from the comments.
